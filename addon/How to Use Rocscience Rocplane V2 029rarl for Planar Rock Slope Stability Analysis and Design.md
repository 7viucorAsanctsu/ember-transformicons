## What is Rocscience Rocplane V2 029.rarl?
 
Rocscience Rocplane V2 029.rarl is a software program that analyzes the stability of planar wedges on rock slopes. A planar wedge is a triangular block of rock that is bounded by two intersecting discontinuities and the slope surface. The software calculates the factor of safety and the probability of failure of the wedge using various methods of analysis, such as limit equilibrium, kinematic, probabilistic, and sensitivity[^1^].
 
Rocscience Rocplane V2 029.rarl also allows you to design adequate bench widths and slope face cuts using bench design tools to reduce the risk of failed material from reaching operating levels below. You can also model the effects of water pressure on the slope and the wedge, as well as apply different types of support systems, such as bolts, cables, or shotcrete[^1^].
 
## How to Use Rocscience Rocplane V2 029.rarl?
 
To use Rocscience Rocplane V2 029.rarl, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download and install the software from [Rocscience website](https://www.rocscience.com/software/rocplane). You can choose between a one-time purchase or a lease option[^1^].
2. Launch the software and create a new project. You can either start from scratch or use one of the predefined templates.
3. Define the slope geometry by entering the slope angle, height, width, and orientation. You can also import slope data from other Rocscience programs or external files.
4. Define the discontinuity sets by entering the dip direction, dip angle, spacing, persistence, and roughness. You can also import discontinuity data from other sources or use the scanline generator tool.
5. Define the material properties by entering the unit weight, cohesion, friction angle, tensile strength, and dilation angle. You can also use predefined material types or import material data from other sources.
6. Define the water conditions by entering the groundwater table depth, pore water pressure coefficient, ponded water depth, and plane water depth. You can also model pervious or impervious slope faces.
7. Define the support conditions by selecting the type of support (bolt, cable, or shotcrete), entering the location, orientation, length, diameter, pretension, stiffness, bond strength, and factor of safety. You can also use predefined support types or import support data from other sources.
8. Analyze the slope stability by selecting the method of analysis (deterministic or probabilistic), entering the number of trials (for probabilistic analysis), and clicking on compute. The software will display the results in graphical and tabular formats.
9. Design the slope by using the bench design tools to optimize the bench width and slope face cut angle. You can also use the sensitivity analysis tool to evaluate the effect of changing various parameters on the factor of safety.
10. Save and export your project. You can also generate reports in various formats (PDF, Word, Excel) or print them directly from the software.
