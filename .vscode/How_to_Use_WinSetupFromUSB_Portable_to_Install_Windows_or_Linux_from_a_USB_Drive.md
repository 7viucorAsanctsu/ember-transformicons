If you want to install Windows or Linux on a new computer or multiple devices, you might find it tedious to use a CD or DVD for each installation. A more convenient and faster way is to use a USB drive that contains the operating system files. You can also create a multiboot USB drive that lets you choose from different operating systems when you boot up your computer.

One of the best tools for creating a bootable or multiboot USB drive is WinSetupFromUSB Portable.

## How to Use WinSetupFromUSB Portable
  
To use WinSetupFromUSB Portable, you need a USB drive with enough space to hold the operating system files. You also need the ISO image of the operating system you want to install. You can download ISO images from the official websites of Windows or Linux distributions.
  
Here are the steps to use WinSetupFromUSB Portable:
  
1. Insert your USB drive into your computer and make sure it is detected.
2. Download WinSetupFromUSB Portable from its official website and extract the ZIP file to a folder of your choice.
3. Run WinSetupFromUSB.exe as administrator and click Refresh if your USB drive is not visible.
4. If your USB drive is not formatted, enable Auto format it with FBinst and select FAT32 or NTFS as the file system. This will erase all data on your USB drive, so make sure you back up any important files before proceeding.
5. At Add to USB disk, enable the box next to the operating system you want to add. For example, if you want to add Windows 10, enable Windows Vista/7/8/10/Server 2008/2012 based ISO.
6. Click the associated â¦ button and browse to the location of your ISO image. Select it and click Open.
7. If you want to add more operating systems, repeat steps 5 and 6 for each one. You can add multiple sets of Windows setup files, as well as Linux and BSD distributions and utilities.
8. When you are done adding operating systems, press GO to start the process. This may take some time depending on the size and number of ISO images you added.
9. When the process is finished, you will see a Job done message. You can now safely eject your USB drive and use it to install Windows or Linux on any compatible computer.

## How to Boot from Your USB Drive
  
To boot from your USB drive, you need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS or UEFI settings. This varies depending on your computer model and manufacturer, but usually involves pressing a key such as F2, F10, F12, or Esc during startup. You can also check your computer's manual or online support for more details.
  
Once you access the BIOS or UEFI settings, look for an option that lets you choose the boot device or priority. Select your USB drive as the first boot option and save the changes. Then exit the BIOS or UEFI settings and restart your computer.
  
You should see a menu that lets you choose which operating system you want to install or run from your USB drive. Use the arrow keys and Enter to select your desired option. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation or operation.
